Abstract:

Many years ago, there was already a method that involved using specialized tools to continuously refresh pages and add items to the shopping cart. Its operation is similar to that of software for purchasing train tickets.

Many potential domain investors may feel confused when considering how to register domain names because they notice that experienced domain investors possess a variety of domains, and they are uncertain about how these domains were accumulated. In reality, the domains held by domain investors are obtained through long-term accumulation. Some domains may have been held for over 20 years, while others were acquired from other individuals. In short, they are gradually amassed. Domain registration indeed requires some techniques, with four main approaches:

1\. Using Registration Tools

Many years ago, a method existed that involved using specialized tools to continuously refresh pages and add items to the shopping cart. Its operation is similar to that of software for purchasing train tickets. You simply set relevant parameters, and the software will automatically refresh pages and notify you for payment upon a successful registration. This method involves waiting for domains to expire, being deleted, and then placing them on the registration market for bidding.

2\. Manual Searches

Using software for registration may incur costs. If you prefer not to spend this money, you can manually input and search for domains one by one. This approach can be labor-intensive and is not recommended unless you have a lot of time to spare.

3\. Bulk Registration

If you have sufficient funds, you can opt for bulk registration. Write down the relevant domain extensions and then proceed to register them one by one, provided they have not already been registered. This method saves time but can be costly.

4\. Purchase from Intermediary Platforms

Those with registration requirements may be investors or individual users. Domain brokers, on the other hand, are professionals in this field and have access to professional channels and extensive networks. For instance, they maintain strong connections with executives of domain registration platforms. They typically offer numerous domain renewal services and can reserve the required domains. When these domains are about to expire, they promptly notify their clients.
