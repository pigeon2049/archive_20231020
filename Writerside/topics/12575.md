1\. What is a .ai domain?

.ai is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Anguilla and stands for "Artificial Intelligence." This domain is well-suited for businesses, projects, and websites related to AI, making it increasingly popular in the fields of technology and innovation.

2\. How to register a .ai domain?

Find a domestic platform that supports .ai domain registration, such as jpisp.com.

Registration of .ai domains is available for a minimum of two years, and you can choose registration periods of 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 years.

Since .ai domains are considered country code domains, there is no need for real-name authentication, and they cannot be subjected to ICP (Internet Content Provider) filing. If you intend to use the domain for a website, you will need a server or host with overseas hosting services.

If the .ai domain you desire has already been registered, you can search for it on platforms like DN.COM and purchase it from the current owner.

3\. Factors affecting .ai domain prices

The annual renewal cost for AI domains is around 1,000 Chinese yuan, making it slightly more expensive than other generic domains. The price depends on several factors, including:

\- Registrar: Different domain registrars may offer varying prices and discounts. When selecting a registrar, ensure that you choose one with a good reputation and check if they provide additional services like domain management and security features.

\- Domain Length: Generally, shorter domain names tend to be more expensive. Short .ai domains might command higher prices because they are easier to remember and promote.

\- Domain Scarcity: Some .ai domains may be more expensive due to their unique relevance to the AI field. Domains that include "AI" or are closely related to AI technologies may be considered scarce resources, thus demanding higher prices.

In summary, .ai domain registration prices typically range from 900 to 1,400 Chinese yuan. These prices are influenced by factors such as the domain's length, scarcity, registrar's pricing policies, and the chosen registration period. Certain specific .ai domains, especially those closely associated with the field of artificial intelligence, may be even more expensive.

If the .ai domain you desire is already registered, don't be discouraged. You can explore professional domain trading platforms to purchase it.
