Friday: the day before the weekend, the last day of the school week or workweek, and the day when companies and people sometimes drop news out of the blue. The Friday news dump!

Sometimes, a news dump means an announcement that, for whatever reason, companies choose not to announce during the week. But often, the news reflects badly on the company or person that dumps it — like, say, [confirming layoffs](https://www.theverge.com/22753434/nintendo-closes-redwood-city-offices-california-toronto-canada), [explaining why you aren’t getting paid as much as you think](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23916539/x-twitter-ad-sharing-revenue-premium-accounts), or [a security breach at a cybersecurity company](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23925864/okta-says-hackers-gained-unauthorized-access-to-its-support-system).

Every time Friday afternoon rolls around (or Wednesday or Thursday if it’s a holiday weekend), there’s a part of my brain that’s preparing for the worst; I’ve been through enough late-in-the-week surprises that they don’t shock me as much as they used to. But now, we’ll be using this storystream to keep track of some of the news dumps we at _The Verge_ get to live through — you, reader, can also experience our pain.

    Okta says hackers gained “unauthorized access” to its support system.
    
    The identity and access management company [says a hacker viewed files](https://sec.okta.com/harfiles) uploaded to its support system by “certain Okta customers.”
    
    Okta says hackers gained access to its support using a stolen credential. However, the company notes that its authentication service was unaffected and is still “fully operational.”

    Nikola recalls 209 trucks after determining a battery fire was due to a leak — not sabotage.
    
    [Theranos-adjacent](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/14/23405107/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-guilty-verdict-hydrogen-truck) trucking company Nikola Motors [admitted late Friday night](https://www.nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-announces-preliminary-results-of-battery-investigations-voluntarily-recalls-209-class-8-battery-electric-trucks/) that “a coolant leak inside a single battery pack was found to be the probable cause of the truck fire” at its HQ on June 23rd. The company blames a supplier component for the leak and says it’s working on a fix for affected trucks, which can stay in service. (via [_Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nikola-recalls-most-of-its-battery-electric-trucks-after-fire-probe-234b5b86)).
    
    Oh, and as for [its initial claim](https://www.theverge.com/e/23535394) that “foul play is suspected”? Here’s the explanation:
    
    > The company’s initial statement on June 23 alluded to foul play as a possible cause of the incident, based on video footage showing a vehicle parked next to the impacted trucks and quickly pulling away after a bright flash and the commencement of the fire. Extensive internal and third party-led hypothesis testing, employee and contractor interviews, and hours of video footage review has since suggested foul play or other external factors were unlikely to have caused the incident.

    Google is ending support for the Dropcam and the Nest Secure home security system in one year, on April 8th, 2024. They are among the few remaining Nest products that haven’t been brought over to Google Home, and their demise hints that [the new Google Home app](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23386287/google-home-app-design-update-matter-features) might _almost_ be here. At least, no more than a year away. Surely.
    
    Google is also winding down the last few legacy Works with Nest connections, but not ‘til September 29th.

    Google is cutting approximately 12,000 jobs — the latest technology firm to initiate significant layoffs as inflation rises and global markets brace for a downturn.
    
    Google SEO Sundar Pichai announced the cuts in an email to staff on Friday and a [blog post](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/). The job losses constitute around 6 percent of Google’s global workforce, compared to recent layoffs at [Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560315/microsoft-job-cuts-layoffs-2023-tech) (10,000 jobs or 5 percent of the workforce), [Amazon](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560874/amazon-layoffs-18000-january-november) (18,000 jobs / 6 percent), and [Meta](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23448926/meta-layoffs-2022) (11,000 / 13 percent). Earlier this month, Google’s parent company Alphabet [announced much smaller cuts](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/11/23550780/alphabet-google-health-verily-layoffs) at Verily, its health-focused subsidiary, and Intrinsic, a subsidiary developing software for industrial robots.

    In the company’s second-quarter results released on August 4th, Wayfair [reported](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/category/company-news/wayfair-announces-second-quarter-2022-results) a decrease in active customers, orders per customer, order deliveries, and a slight decrease in orders delivered via Wayfair’s mobile app and in other areas. Overall, Wayfair saw a nearly 15 percent decrease in net revenue compared to its earnings in 2021.

Peloton will also increase the prices of the Bike Plus and Tread, while shuttering retail showrooms starting in 2023.

    News Corp, the media company that owns _The Wall Street Journal_, said in a [Friday filing](https://investors.newscorp.com/node/11716/html) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it was the victim of a cyberattack last month. Its security consultant Mandiant, which is investigating the hack, believes the attackers “are likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China’s interests,” Mandiant vice president of incident response David Wong said in an email to _The Verge_.
    
    According to the SEC filing, the company discovered in January that one of its cloud-based systems was the target of “persistent cyberattack activity.” A preliminary analysis found that “foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity, and that data was taken.” News Corp. said in the filing that its financial and customer data were not affected and that it believes the threat activity has been contained. [_The Wall Street Journal_ reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cyberattack-on-news-corp-believed-linked-to-china-targeted-emails-of-journalists-others-11643979328) Friday that emails and documents of its journalists were among those targeted in the hack.

    Spotify is disbanding its founding podcast studio and laying off some of the team. An affected employee tells _The Verge_ that Studio 4, or Spotify Studios as it’s been referenced externally, consisted of 10 to 15 employees and produced shows like _Dissect_ and _Chapo: Kingpin on Trial_. Spotify called affected employees on Friday and said their last days would be January 21st. They’ll receive two months’ worth of severance. Some employees were reassigned while others were laid off and pointed to the Spotify job board. The studio’s head, Gina Delvac, was also let go.
    
    Spotify declined to comment. In a note to Spotify staff obtained by _The Verge_, however, Julie McNamara, head of US studios and video, acknowledged the layoffs and said shutting the studio down would enable the company to “move faster and make more significant progress and facilitate more effective collaboration across our organization.”

    _Pokémon Go_ developer Niantic is shutting down its augmented reality game _Catan: World Explorers_, [the company announced on Friday](https://community.catanworldexplorers.com/discussion/1811/catan-world-explorers-is-shutting-down/p1) ([via _Protocol_](https://www.protocol.com/pokemon-go-maker-niantic-is-shutting-down-its-ar-catan-game)). An AR adaptation of the popular board game _Catan_ [announced in 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976421/settlers-of-catan-ar-niantic-world-explorers-pokemon-go-augmented-reality), _World Explorers_ was the company’s latest attempt to recreate the magic of _Pokémon Go,_ but soon it’s all coming to an end.
    
    After a year of early access, the game will not be playable after November 18th and Niantic says later today it “will be taking the game down from the App Store and removing real-money purchases from the Shop.” For the players that stick around, the company says it will increase in-game bonuses for the remaining weeks the game is live.

    On Friday evening, Twitter issued [its first full blog post](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html) about what happened after the biggest security lapse in the company’s history, one that led to attackers [getting hold of some of the highest profile Twitter accounts in the world](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised) — including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, President Barack Obama, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Kanye West, Michael Bloomberg, and more.
    
    The bad news: Twitter has now revealed that the attackers _may indeed_ have downloaded the private direct messages (DMs) of up to 8 individuals while conducting their Bitcoin scam, and were able to see “personal information” including phone numbers and email addresses for every account they targeted.

    Microsoft is laying off dozens of journalists and editorial workers at its Microsoft News and MSN organizations. The layoffs are part of a bigger push by Microsoft to rely on artificial intelligence to pick news and content that’s presented on MSN.com, inside Microsoft’s Edge browser, and in the company’s various Microsoft News apps. Many of the affected workers are part of Microsoft’s SANE (search, ads, News, Edge) division, and are contracted as human editors to help pick stories.
    
    “Like all companies, we evaluate our business on a regular basis,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement. “This can result in increased investment in some places and, from time to time, re-deployment in others. These decisions are not the result of the current pandemic.”

    Zoox, the ambitious self-driving startup said to be worth over $3 billion, laid off almost all of its contract workers last week, including its backup drivers who ride around in the company’s autonomous vehicles. Around 120 people are said to be out of work.
    
    Zoox workers were informed in an email sent on Friday that their jobs were being terminated effective immediately. They were told that they were being locked out of the company’s email, Zoom, and Slack, and would be required to turn in their company-issued laptops and badges. But Zoox also insisted that this should not be “considered a standard layoff.” The company said that it will hire everyone back “once the shelter in place is lifted, unless stated otherwise.”

    “We are closing our stores in California,” GameStop said in a letter to stores leaked to _Kotaku_. “The closure will remain in effect until further notice as we obtain more information from the California Governor’s Office.” _Kotaku_ also notes that GameStop will not pay its employees during the shutdown, though some may be able to [use personal time off](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1241091124581806087?s=20).

The company announced [on March 3rd](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163553/google-io-2020-cancelled-coronavirus-tech-developer-conference) that it canceled the physical I/O event, but now the whole thing is off.
    
    “Out of concern for the health and safety of our developers, employees, and local communities — and in line with recent ‘shelter in place’ orders by the local Bay Area counties — we sadly will not be holding I/O in any capacity this year,” Google said in a statement on the [I/O website](https://events.google.com/io/). “Right now, the most important thing all of us can do is focus our attention on helping people with the new challenges we all face. Please know that we remain committed to finding other ways to share platform updates with you through our developer blogs and community forums.”

    Randy Freer is stepping down from his role as Hulu CEO as Disney moves to consolidate its direct-to-consumer business under its own executives. Part of the decision to roll Hulu’s business operations into Disney’s direct-to-consumer division is to help “rapidly grow our presence outside the US,” according to a company press release put out Friday.
    
    Disney hasn’t shied away from its plans to roll out Hulu in various international territories, along with its [other streaming service, Disney+](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913417/disney-plus-launch-lineup-marvel-star-wars-pixar-tv-shows-movies-simpsons-national-geographic). The integration means Hulu executives will now report to Disney execs. Everything Hulu — and streaming-at-large — will now operate under Kevin Mayer, who heads up the division for Disney that includes Disney+, [ESPN+](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226998/espn-plus-preview-hands-on-features-disney-streaming), and now Hulu.

All 24 employees, most of whom were located at the company’s headquarters in Santa Cruz, California, have been laid off.
    
    The startup was one of the highest-profile competitors to top electric skateboard company Boosted, and last year announced plans to enter the electric scooter market — a push that seems to have doomed Inboard.

    Microsoft has admitted that its Outlook.com security breach was worse than the company initially revealed. The software maker started [notifying some Outlook.com users](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/13/18309192/microsoft-outlook-email-account-hack-breach-security) late on Friday night that a hacker was able to access accounts for months earlier this year. Microsoft’s notification revealed that hackers could have viewed account email addresses, folder names, and subject lines of emails, but in a separate notification to other affected users the company also admitted email contents could have been viewed.
    
    [Vice’s Motherboard revealed](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywyz3x/hackers-could-read-your-hotmail-msn-outlook-microsoft-customer-support) on Sunday that Microsoft sent a different notification message to around six percent of the affected Outlook.com accounts, and that the company only admitted this when it was presented with screenshot evidence that the breach was far worse for those customers. Microsoft discovered that a support agent’s credentials were compromised for its web mail service, allowing unauthorized access to some accounts between January 1st and March 28th, 2019.

    Telltale Games, creators of episodic adventure games like _The Walking Dead_, _The Wolf Among Us_, and _Batman: The Enemy Within_, laid off approximately 250 employees today as part of what the company is calling a “majority studio closure.” According to multiple sources _The Verge_ spoke with, employees were let go with no severance.
    
    “Today Telltale Games made the difficult decision to begin a majority studio closure following a year marked by insurmountable challenges,” [the company said in a statement](https://twitter.com/telltalegames/status/1043252010999410689). “A majority of the company’s employees were dismissed earlier this morning.” The company will retain a small team of 25. These remaining employees will stay on “to fulfill the company’s obligations to its board and partners,” according to Telltale.

    Facebook said late Friday that [it had suspended Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), along with its political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/suspending-cambridge-analytica/), for violating its policies around data collection and retention. The companies, which [ran data operations for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/16/15657512/mueller-fbi-cambridge-analytica-trump-russia), are widely credited with helping Trump more effectively target voters on Facebook than his rival, Hillary Clinton. While the exact nature of their role remains somewhat mysterious, Facebook’s disclosure suggests that the company improperly obtained user data that could have given it an unfair advantage in reaching voters.
    
    Facebook said it cannot determine whether or how the data in question could have been used in conjunction with election ad campaigns. Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    Newly appointed FCC chairman Ajit Pai reversed a number of his predecessors’ actions this afternoon, including [shutting down a series of inquiries into net neutrality violations](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14501898/att-verizon-t-mobile-sponsored-data-fcc).
    
    While those were the more attention-grabbing changes, Pai also took actions that suggest he’s planning to alter Federal Communications Commission programs that subsidize broadband for schools and low-income families.

    As 2015 drew to a close, you might be forgiven for thinking the encryption debate was all talk. There had been a lot of speeches and it was clear the FBI didn’t like Apple’s default encryption system — but what could they actually do about it? They had been leaning on Congress all year and getting nowhere.
    
    Then, everything changed. On February 16th, the FBI took Apple to court over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers, putting encryption at the center of the largest terrorism-linked shooting in the US in years. A similar phone-unlocking order was already being argued in New York, and the two cases plunged Apple into a legal crisis, as the company faced the possibility that a single ruling might undo years of security work.
