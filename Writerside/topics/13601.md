React Native Bottom Sheet is a smart, tiny, and flexible bottom sheet component for React Native. It is highly configurable and can be used with FlatList, SectionList, ScrollView, and View scrolling interactions. It follows Material Design principles and is compatible with Expo. The bottom sheet can be opened and closed imperatively using a ref. It is important to avoid putting the bottom sheet inside a container that supports panning, such as ScrollView.
