With just two weeks left until the opening of the inaugural Domain Days Dubai, Munir Badr, the founder of the UAE's new conference, told us that the response to the event has exceeded all expectations. 'I never thought a domain event would receive such a warm response,' Badr said, referring to the demand for tickets and the number of experts flying in from around the world to attend the exhibition. 'We now have 38 speakers set to appear in the two-day agenda from November 1st to 2nd,' Munir pointed out. 'As for registrations, over 170 people (all B2B professionals) have purchased tickets, and the hotel rooms at the Jumeirah Palm Island Marriott Resort are already sold out.'

'We are now in the final stages of planning, and everything is progressing smoothly,' Munir added. 'We will have large LED screens, delicious food and coffee breaks, a delightful dinner, and we have even upgraded the second-day yacht party to a stunning 155-foot/47-meter yacht, allowing us to accommodate more VIPs than the previous boat could hold – 65.'

Badr has arranged for four top moderators - Braden Pollock, Tess Diaz, James Williams (MEF), and Leonid Todorov (APTLD) - to pose various questions, which will yield valuable insights from dozens of experts taking the stage during Domain Days Dubai. Munir is also pleased to announce that Abdulrahman Almarzouqi will serve as the organization's head. The ae registration management organization (the UAE's ccTLD) has accepted the invitation and will deliver the opening-day keynote speech.

As of the time of writing this article, a limited number of tickets are still available on the Domain Days website. VIP tickets are priced at $499, and standard tickets are priced at $299.
